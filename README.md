Python Program for Word Guessing Game
Python is an extremely versatile programming language employed by many large companies. It is a simple and easy-to-understand syntax, which makes it perfect for those trying to master computer programming for the first time. It is a high-level programming language. Its fundamental design principle is about understanding code and the syntax that lets programmers communicate concepts within a few lines of code.

Random Module:
Sometimes, we need the computer to choose the random number from the specified range, choose an element randomly from a set, choose the random card from an assortment of decks, flip a coin, and so on. The random module allows the ability to access functions that can support these kinds of operations. One of these operations is the random.choice() technique (returns an unspecified item from a tuple, list, or string.) which we'll make use of to choose the random words from a set of terms we've generated.

Word Guessing Game:
The game involves an array of words from which our interpreter will select one random word. The player must first input their names and is challenged to guess the alphabet of their choice after that. If the random word is comprised of the alphabet, it will be displayed in the output (with proper placement); otherwise, the program will prompt you to choose an alternative alphabet. Users will be given 12 turns (can be modified according to) to determine the full word.
